# Port all nine scripts to Python

## ⏵ STATE — READ THIS FIRST ON RESUME (authoritative; supersedes the body) — 2026-09-07

**Method (do not vary it).** The JS suite is held FIXED as the ORACLE; only the implementation
varies. Any divergence is a porting defect, never a re-specified test. `AD_RUNTIME=python`
switches `dispatch-tests.mjs`, `lint-tests.mjs` and `ledger-tests.mjs` to the port. Paired
drivers (`X-drive.mjs` / `X_drive.py`) dump every observable effect as JSON; the diff is the
test.

**Every check pairs with a control proving it CAN fail.** A green run is the weakest evidence in
this project — the recurring defect all session has been an assertion satisfied by something
other than the property it names. Mutate the implementation, confirm the intended row reddens,
revert. If no mutation isolates a row, that row does not earn its place.

### DONE (verified by differential + mutation control)
- `lib/gates.py`: `read_stable_regular_file`, `write_atomic`, `with_file_lock`, `append_status`,
  `parse_gates`, `validate_scope_id`, `scope_root`, `normalize_owns_glob`, `_write_all`
- `lib/dispatch.py` + `dispatch_check.py` — 21/21 under the oracle's own suite
- `lib/jsapi.py`: `js_object_key_order`, `js_json_object`, `js_length`, `js_slice`,
  `locale_compare_key`, `parse_date`, `js_trim`, `js_truthy`, `js_string`/`_js_number`
- `gates.py`: `gate_definition_digest`, `automatic_evidence_prefix`, `classify_gate_evidence`,
  `gate_state`, `tail`, `format_document`, `qualify`, `js_basename`
- `gates.py`: `globs_overlap`, `literal_prefix` — 18 pairs, each dumped in BOTH directions.
  Six mutation controls all redden. The doubling is EARNED, not defensive: dropping the `or`
  from the wildcard test changes only ODD indices (measured `[1, 3, 15, 17, 19]`), so a
  one-direction corpus ships that defect. Symmetry is a discriminating property here — it
  holds for the oracle and BREAKS under that mutant. The astral rows are a CONTROL, not a
  catch: this function only tests EQUALITY, where UTF-16 and code points agree; the `<`
  divergence has no site here. The measured `OWNS:` placeholder disjointness is PINNED as a
  row, so the port reproduces the defect rather than quietly diverging from the oracle.

### NEXT ACTION
1. **The 7 remaining `gates.mjs` exports**, in dependency order: `sameFileIdentity`,
   `statCurrentNamedFile`, `listScopes`, `scopeFiles`, `legacyFiles`, `resolveTarget`,
   `readLeases`. All are FILESYSTEM-facing, so the differential needs a built tree, not a
   string corpus — and the divergence classes shift accordingly: `errno` names vs `strerror`,
   `readdir` order vs `os.scandir` order (neither sorted; `listScopes` sorts, the others may
   not), symlink and `realpath` behaviour, and `existsSync` swallowing every error where
   `os.path.exists` does the same but `os.stat` does not.
2. **`gate-check.mjs`** (950 lines) — last, because it consumes all of the above.

### GOTCHAS THAT HAVE ALREADY COST TIME — do not rediscover these
- **Stale `.pyc` makes two measurements of the same code disagree.** A `.pyc` validates on
  `(source mtime, source size)` ALONE, so a SAME-SIZE rewrite inside one mtime second — exactly
  what a mutation probe does — runs the OLD bytecode while the `.py` reads correct.
  `inspect.getsource()` cannot reveal it. Prefix ad-hoc probes with `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`
  (or `python3 -B`). The suites and drivers are already guarded; a hand-typed
  `python3 -c "...import gates..."` is not.
- **Mutation probes need a UNIQUE anchor.** A first-match `replace(old, new, 1)` reverted into a
  DIFFERENT function once, silently editing code the probe never targeted.
- **Escapes typed into a tool call materialise into literal characters.** Writing `U+2028` put a
  real bidi control into source twice, and the escape for U+0085 became U+2026 in a fixture, making the row
  inert. Build hostile characters with `chr()` / `String.fromCodePoint()`; never type them.
- **`str.splitlines()` splits on U+2028/U+2029/U+0085/VT/FF** — an invisible-character scanner
  built on it consumes the very characters it searches for and reports files clean that are not.
- The JS/Python trap list, each already found live: UTF-16 length & slice; JS object key order
  (integer-like keys first); `$` vs `\Z`; ASCII-vs-Unicode regex classes; `json.dumps`
  separators + `ensure_ascii`; `.trim()` vs `.strip()` (differs BOTH ways); `String()` vs
  `str()`; JS truthiness (NaN falsy, `{}`/`[]` truthy); `Math.max([])`; errno names vs strerror;
  `path.basename` strips trailing separators.

### KNOWN GAPS, recorded rather than hidden
- `str(cwd)` in `gate_definition_digest` is not `String(cwd)` for a non-str. Unreachable from
  `parse_gates`; goes live when `hardening-tests.mjs` (which hand-builds gates) is ported.
- `js_basename` on a Windows UNC root: `ntpath.basename` answers `""` where node answers
  `"share"`. Pre-existing in the delegate; no test here runs on Windows.
- `with_file_lock` CONTENTION has zero coverage (needs two processes).
- `re.ASCII` on `_MD_SUFFIX_RE` is defensive and UNWITNESSED — measured, no character folds onto
  "m" or "d", so no row can distinguish its presence.

## Why this TRDD exists

The ordered plan lived only in `docs_dev/gate-check-port-plan.md`, which is gitignored working
state — correct for scratch, wrong for the one artifact a future session must resume from. The
decisions now live here, where they are tracked, survive a clone, and are captured verbatim in
every compaction handoff (which reads in-flight TRDD STATE blocks). The scratch file stays put.
