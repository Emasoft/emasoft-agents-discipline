# Port all nine scripts to Python

## ⏵ STATE — READ THIS FIRST ON RESUME (authoritative; supersedes the body) — 2026-09-07

**Method (do not vary it).** The JS suite is held FIXED as the ORACLE; only the implementation
varies. Any divergence is a porting defect, never a re-specified test. `AD_RUNTIME=python`
switches `dispatch-tests.mjs`, `lint-tests.mjs` and `ledger-tests.mjs` to the port. Paired
drivers (`X-drive.mjs` / `X_drive.py`) dump every observable effect as JSON; the diff is the
test.

**Every check pairs with a control proving it CAN fail.** A green run is the weakest evidence in
this project — the recurring defect all session has been an assertion satisfied by something
other than the property it names. Mutate the implementation, confirm the intended row reddens,
revert. If no mutation isolates a row, that row does not earn its place.

### DONE (verified by differential + mutation control)
- `lib/gates.py`: `read_stable_regular_file`, `write_atomic`, `with_file_lock`, `append_status`,
  `parse_gates`, `validate_scope_id`, `scope_root`, `normalize_owns_glob`, `_write_all`
- `lib/dispatch.py` + `dispatch_check.py` — 21/21 under the oracle's own suite
- `lib/jsapi.py`: `js_object_key_order`, `js_json_object`, `js_length`, `js_slice`,
  `locale_compare_key`, `parse_date`, `js_trim`, `js_truthy`, `js_string`/`_js_number`
- `gates.py`: `gate_definition_digest`, `automatic_evidence_prefix`, `classify_gate_evidence`,
  `gate_state`, `tail`, `format_document`, `qualify`, `js_basename`

### NEXT ACTION
1. **`globsOverlap` / `literalPrefix`** — the lease-conflict decision, and the highest-severity
   remaining piece: a false "disjoint" grants two workers write access to the same paths, a
   failure already observed live (the unreplaced `OWNS:` placeholder let two claims both exit 0).
   Needs a SYMMETRY row (`overlap(a,b) == overlap(b,a)` for every pair in the corpus) plus
   adversarial pairs: `src/**` vs `src/a`, `a*` vs `ab`, and one astral path — JS string `<`
   compares UTF-16 code units and Python compares code points, which disagree for astral
   characters.
2. **`gate-check.mjs`** (950 lines) and the ~10 remaining `gates.mjs` helpers.

### GOTCHAS THAT HAVE ALREADY COST TIME — do not rediscover these
- **Stale `.pyc` makes two measurements of the same code disagree.** A `.pyc` validates on
  `(source mtime, source size)` ALONE, so a SAME-SIZE rewrite inside one mtime second — exactly
  what a mutation probe does — runs the OLD bytecode while the `.py` reads correct.
  `inspect.getsource()` cannot reveal it. Prefix ad-hoc probes with `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`
  (or `python3 -B`). The suites and drivers are already guarded; a hand-typed
  `python3 -c "...import gates..."` is not.
- **Mutation probes need a UNIQUE anchor.** A first-match `replace(old, new, 1)` reverted into a
  DIFFERENT function once, silently editing code the probe never targeted.
- **Escapes typed into a tool call materialise into literal characters.** Writing ` ` put a
  real bidi control into source twice, and `` became U+2026 in a fixture, making the row
  inert. Build hostile characters with `chr()` / `String.fromCodePoint()`; never type them.
- **`str.splitlines()` splits on U+2028/U+2029/U+0085/VT/FF** — an invisible-character scanner
  built on it consumes the very characters it searches for and reports files clean that are not.
- The JS/Python trap list, each already found live: UTF-16 length & slice; JS object key order
  (integer-like keys first); `$` vs `\Z`; ASCII-vs-Unicode regex classes; `json.dumps`
  separators + `ensure_ascii`; `.trim()` vs `.strip()` (differs BOTH ways); `String()` vs
  `str()`; JS truthiness (NaN falsy, `{}`/`[]` truthy); `Math.max([])`; errno names vs strerror;
  `path.basename` strips trailing separators.

### KNOWN GAPS, recorded rather than hidden
- `str(cwd)` in `gate_definition_digest` is not `String(cwd)` for a non-str. Unreachable from
  `parse_gates`; goes live when `hardening-tests.mjs` (which hand-builds gates) is ported.
- `js_basename` on a Windows UNC root: `ntpath.basename` answers `""` where node answers
  `"share"`. Pre-existing in the delegate; no test here runs on Windows.
- `with_file_lock` CONTENTION has zero coverage (needs two processes).
- `re.ASCII` on `_MD_SUFFIX_RE` is defensive and UNWITNESSED — measured, no character folds onto
  "m" or "d", so no row can distinguish its presence.

## Why this TRDD exists

The ordered plan lived only in `docs_dev/gate-check-port-plan.md`, which is gitignored working
state — correct for scratch, wrong for the one artifact a future session must resume from. The
decisions now live here, where they are tracked, survive a clone, and are captured verbatim in
every compaction handoff (which reads in-flight TRDD STATE blocks). The scratch file stays put.
